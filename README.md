## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn
- Python 3.11+ (for backend)

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/edufire
cd edufire
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or if you use yarn
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or if you use yarn
yarn dev
```

4. Open your browser and visit:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GOODFIRE_API_KEY=your_goodfire_api_key
```

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
python app.py
```

The backend server will start on port 8084.

### Common Issues

- If you see a blank page, make sure both frontend and backend servers are running
- For port conflicts, check if ports 5173 (frontend) and 8084 (backend) are available
- For module not found errors, try deleting node_modules and package-lock.json, then run npm install again
